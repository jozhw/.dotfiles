* Commenting
** =C-x C-;=

Comment or uncomment the current line (comment-line). If the region is active, comment or uncomment the lines in the region instead. 

* Dired
** =C-x d=

Enter dired mode.

** =C-x C-q=

Enter Wdired mode (write dired).

In this mode, you can edit file names just like you would any file. However, when you have completed the edits of the dired, make sure to run the command =C-c C-c= to finish.
