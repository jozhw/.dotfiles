For a comprehensive guide to using Starlight, which is an official documentation template by the Astro team, please see the [documentation](https://starlight.astro.build/).

## Development

To enable a development server, using the javascript package manager of your choice, in this case I am using `yarn`, rrun the development server as indicated by the [documentation](https://starlight.astro.build/). For this particular build run `yarn dev`.

## Building

To build run `yarn build` and to preview the build run `yarn astro preview`. Of course substitute the build command with the package manager used.
