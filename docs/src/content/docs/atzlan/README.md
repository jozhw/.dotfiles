description: Atzlan is a repository to be lazy.
---

"Atzlan" is the English translation of the Hebrew word for lazy, indolent, or sluggish. As the name implies, this repository is for those who seek to be "lazy" or are "lazy." Joking aside, the purpose of this respository is to house scripts that can make your life easier.


> All the scripts, unless otherwise noted, are geared towards macos users using bash shell.
> Linux users may benefit depending on their shell configurations.

## Purpose of Atzlan

There are many useful cli tools, however keeping track of them all becomes exceedingly cumbersome. Furthermore, how often do we use certain commands? Maybe once in a blue moon? If the usage becomes infrequent then forgetfulness sets in. Hence, the purpose of this repository is to house all scripts that I found useful and provide quick references to help remind me of certain commands that I may need.

## Documentation Structure

The documentation will follow the directory organization. I will not specify the exact organization here because if there is a refactor then I would have to update it here. In other words, I am lazy.
