## Fonts

This emacs configuration, if running the GUI version requires the font type called [iosevka-comfy](https:/*github.com*protesilaos/iosevka-comfy). I have a copy of the git repo attached as a submodule in the fonts directory of this repository. Make sure that have that font style installed.
