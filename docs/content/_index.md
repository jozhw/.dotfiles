#  dotfiles

## Purpose

The purpose of this documentation is not for organization nor is it for sharing my dotfiles configuration; rather it is for documenting things that I found useful or may forget when it comes to the setup, configuration, implementation, and usage of my dotfiles. 

I attempted to keep some degree of order, however since the focus is on pure documentation, aesthetics does not matter. Hence, if you are interested in some of the dotfiles implementations then it may be somewhat difficult to find what you are looking for. I apologize in advance. My view if not already conveyed is that too much focus on organization and beautification would be a colossal waste of time given the purpose of this documentation. Unfortunately, the utility of such from those who are not me is further impeded by the limitations of the search functionality.

As a justification for my reasoning if you believe these docs are disorganized, chaos is the natural progression from order as order is a natural progression from chaos - the cycle of being.

## Info

The template for this documentation is called `hugo-book` and the link is [here](https://github.com/alex-shpak/hugo-book). This template serves me well given the simplicity and the lack of unnecessary bloat for my usecase.
