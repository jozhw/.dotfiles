# Introduction

There are important or common commands used in base emacs without any third-party packages (maybe except evil-mode).

# Commenting

- `C-x C-;`: Comment or uncomment the current line (comment-line). If the region is active, comment or uncomment the lines in the region instead. 

# Indenting

- `C-x TAB`: Use the arrow keys (← or →) to indent interactively and then press =esc= three times to finish indenting.

# Dired

- `C-x d`: Enter dired mode.
- `C-x C-q`: Enter Wdired mode (write dired). In this mode, you can edit file names just like you would any file. However, when you have completed the edits of the dired, make sure to run the command =C-c C-c= to finish.

# Links

- `C-c C-o`: When the cursor is over a link, this command will open the link

- `C-c C-l`: When the cursor is over a link, this command will open the link in a minibuffer for editing.


# Special Symbols

To access special symbols run the `C-x 8 RET`

- "—" (`em-dash`)
