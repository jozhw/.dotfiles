# Introduction

*HUGO* is what I use for this documentation. Here are some of the important configs or commands to know and to have a reference in case I forget.

## Development Server

To start a development server run the following command in the root directory of the HUGO files, which is not necessarily the root directory of the project:

``` shell
    hugo server --minify
```
