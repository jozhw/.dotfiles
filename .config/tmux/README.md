# Personal TMUX Configuration

The tmux.conf file contains the tmux config that I personally use for iterm2.

The tmux_selector script is to be run outside of tmux to access all sessions
and navigate to the session of interest.

## Install TMUX

For macos users, the simplist way is via homebrew.

```
brew install tmux
```

For other users please consult the [tmux page](https://tmux.github.io).
